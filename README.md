# ParaMemo 1.1.0

### **A Minimalist Memory Training Application**

The **ParaMemo 1.1.0** beta version is now open for testing.

ParaMemo is a minimalist web application designed to help users improve their memory and focus. By breaking down a paragraph into smaller, manageable parts, the app guides you through a structured memorization process. You first submit a paragraph, then practice recalling it incrementally, one section at a time. The app provides immediate feedback on correctness and only enables user input when it's your turn to type. This structured approach makes memorization an interactive and effective exercise.

### **Key Features**

* **Interactive Practice**: Guides you to memorize paragraphs by section.
* **Structured Feedback**: Provides immediate feedback (correct/incorrect) on your progress.
* **Intuitive UI**: Disables the input field and submit button when the program is "thinking" to prevent accidental input.

### **How to Use**

1.  Paste a paragraph into the text box and press **Submit**.
2.  The app will show you the first part of the paragraph. Memorize it.
3.  When prompted, type the words you memorized and press **Submit** again.
4.  Repeat this process as the app gradually adds more words to the section you need to recall.
5.  After the practice is complete, you will be asked to type the entire paragraph to test your final recall.
