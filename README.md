# ParaMemo 1.3.0  
A Sleek Memory Training Application  

The ParaMemo 1.3.0 beta version is now open for testing.  

ParaMemo is a lightweight web application designed to sharpen memory and focus. By splitting text into smaller, customizable parts ("chunks"), the app helps you practice memorization step by step. With its clean glassmorphic console, moving gradient background, and smoother controls, the new UI makes memorization feel more engaging and polished.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Practice**: Memorize text incrementally, one chunk at a time.  
- **Structured Feedback**: Instantly see if your input is correct or incorrect, highlighted with color-coded results.  
- **Intuitive Console UI**: Sleek, glassy console with smoother buttons and an embedded favicon for a modern look.  
- **Progressive Memorization**: Builds from small chunks to the full paragraph, strengthening recall.  
- **Error Details**: Pinpoints missing, extra, or incorrect words for precise feedback.  
- **Retry Options**: Retry the final paragraph or restart the practice flow.

## How to Use  
1. Paste or type a paragraph into the text box, then press **Submit**.  
2. Enter how many words per chunk you want to memorize (or leave blank to default to 2).  
3. The app will display the first chunk. Memorize it.  
4. When prompted, type the chunk you just memorized and press **Submit** again.  
5. Each round adds more words until youâ€™ve built up to the full paragraph.  
6. At the end, test yourself by recalling the entire text.  
7. If needed, retry the final test or redo the practice sequence.

# ParaMemo 1.2.0 (Outdated)
A Minimalist Memory Training Application

The ParaMemo 1.2.0 beta version is now open for testing.

ParaMemo is a minimalist web application designed to help users improve their memory and focus. By breaking down a paragraph into smaller, manageable parts, the app guides you through a structured memorization process. You first submit a paragraph, then practice recalling it incrementally, one section at a time. The app provides immediate feedback on correctness and only enables user input when it's your turn to type. This structured approach makes memorization an interactive and effective exercise.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Practice**: Guides you to memorize paragraphs by section.  
- **Structured Feedback**: Highlights correct and incorrect attempts with color-coded feedback.  
- **Intuitive UI**: Disables the input field and submit button when the program is "thinking" to prevent accidental input.  
- **Progressive Memorization**: A step-by-step approach that helps you build confidence and retain information.  
- **Chunk Highlighting**: Highlights the current chunk to focus on during memorization.  
- **Error Details**: Shows missing, extra, or incorrect words to help you pinpoint mistakes.  
- **Flexible Retry Options**: Allows retrying the final paragraph or redoing the practice from the beginning.  

## How to Use
1. Paste a paragraph into the text box and press **Submit**.  
2. The app will show you the first part of the paragraph. Memorize it.  
3. When prompted, type the words you memorized and press **Submit** again.  
4. Repeat this process as the app gradually adds more words to the section you need to recall.  
5. After the practice is complete, you will be asked to type the entire paragraph to test your final recall.  
6. If needed, choose to retry the final input or redo the practice to improve your score.
